<p> Welcome to our Website!</p>
	 <h3> Why we started Tennis Tales </h3>
	 <p> Tennis has a growing community, and lots of stories to tell. Besides highlighting these stories, it is nice to have a site that can keep you updated on the biggest tournaments for tennis </p>
<p> While browsing other pages such as Yahoo sports, it was somewhat difficult to navigate the page quickly and efficiently when looking for specific stats or stories. Tennis Tales should have easy navigation and more.  </p>
