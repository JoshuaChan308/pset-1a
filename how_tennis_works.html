  <p> If you are new to tennis all of the rules may seem daunting. For starters, there is two ways to play tennis competitively, singles and doubles. In doubles, two players are on each side of the court. The teammates are on the same side of the court and try to beat the other group. In singles, one person is on each side of the court and compete. </p>
  <h2> How scoring works </h2>
  <p> Tennis scoring goes as such: </p>
  <ol>
    <li> Point </li>
    <li> Game </li>
    <li> Set </li>
    <li> Match </li>
  </ol>
  <p> You get a point when the opponent hits the ball out, the opponent misses two serves in a row, the opponent hits the ball into the net, or you hit the ball in and the ball bounces two times. </p>
  <p> You win a game when you win 4 points, and your opponent wins 2 points or less. If your opponent and you both with 3 points, you will need to win by two more points to win the game. </p>
  <p> To win a set you must win 6 games and your opponent win 4 or less. If your opponent and you both win 5 games, you will need to win by two games to win the set. </p>
  <p> To win the match you must win 3 sets. Here is an example of a scorecard after a match:</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th> Players </th>
      <th> Set 1 </th>
      <th> Set 2 </th>
      <th> Set 3 </th>
      <th> Set 4 </th>
      <th> Set 5 </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> Bob</td>
      <td> 6 </td>
      <td> 4 </td>
      <td> 3 </td>
      <td> 6 </td>
      <td> 6 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> Jones</td>
      <td> 3 </td>
      <td> 6 </td>
      <td> 6 </td>
      <td> 4 </td>
      <td> 1 </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
